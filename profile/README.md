## Lyra Programming Language 👋🚀

Lyra started as an effort to add types to Python and create a compiler for the newly formated language using LLVMLite.
While seeking funding for FPGAs and operations, we drifted into web3, an NFT platform and cryptocurrencies, but are now
back on track to make Lyra happen. We were evaluating the idea of a full-scale LLVM compiler or rather an interpreted 
language that interpolates with Python3. Also the creation of a Virtual Machine (VM) was discussed.

**Here are some ideas to get you started with Lyra:**

🙋‍♀️ A short introduction - what is you and your project all about?

👩‍💻 Useful resources - where can the community find your docs? Is there anything else the community should know?

🍿 Fun facts - what does your team eat for breakfast?

🧙 Remember, you can do mighty things with the power of [Markdown](https://docs.github.com/github/writing-on-github/getting-started-with-writing-and-formatting-on-github/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax)
